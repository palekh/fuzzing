# Fuzzing ¬∑ üê∞
It is tool to perform **fuzz testing**. Sometimes it's hard to understand if your function would crash if you pass `null` or `undefined` or any unusual value into it. To check that you're doing right you can use this package for stress testing your functions and APIs under different payloads.

# Usage
First of all you need to install package like:
```
npm i fuzzing -SD
```

To start fuzzing follow few steps:
* pick function you want to test (fuzz)
* select set of input values, which will be used as arguments passed into the function
* choose output type if you want to see `errors` or `warnings` produced after function execution

```js
import {fuzz} from 'fuzzing';

/**
 * Let's assume that you want to test your perfectly written sum function to find some bugs or unexpected behaviours 
 */
function sum(arr) {
   return arr.reduce((accumulator, item) => accumulator + item, 0);
}

const errors = fuzz(sum) // 1. pick function you want to test (fuzz)
   .string()             // 2. select set of input values from: number, string, boolean, numberArray, stringArray, booleanArray, all
   .errors();            // 3. choose output type from: successes, warnings, errors, all

console.log(errors); // print result if needed to see what's going on
// it would give you array of executed tests showing you input value / test result and stack trace in case of any error
/*
